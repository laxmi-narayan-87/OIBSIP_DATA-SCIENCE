### OASIS
AICTE Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Overview Welcome to my GitHub repository for the AICTE Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship. This repository contains all the tasks and projects I completed during my internship, showcasing my journey and growth in the field of data science.


**#TASK1**
**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.



Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning.

**#TASK2**
**CAR PRICE PREDICTION**

Car price prediction involves creating a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, etc. The goal is to accurately estimate the price of a car using historical data and feature analysis.

**#TASK3** 
**SPAM DETECTION**

Spam detection is the process of identifying and filtering out unwanted or unsolicited emails, messages, or content based on certain criteria. The task involves training a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not spam, using features such as text content, sender information, and other relevant attributes.
